Specs so far:
1. MongoDB - database to store users base data to connect them with their favourite movies
2. Login with Google
3. NextJS + React - App routing
4. Used https://www.themoviedb.org/ API to fetch movies

2. Tag/Untag favourites - save against the user
3. Display favourites of the profile page (limit for the testing purpose to 20)
4. Implement search
5. Infinite scroll / pagination of the movies list
